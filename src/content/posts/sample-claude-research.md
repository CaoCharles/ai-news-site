# Anthropic Releases Claude 3.5 Opus

Anthropic continues its focus on AI safety with the release of **Claude 3.5 Opus**.

## Safety First

Claude 3.5 introduces "Constitutional AI v2", which allows for more fine-grained control over the model's values and refusal boundaries.

*   **Lower False Refusals**: The model is less likely to refuse harmless prompts.
*   **Nuanced Understanding**: Better at grasping subtle context in creative writing.

Experts are praising the release for its balance of power and responsibility.

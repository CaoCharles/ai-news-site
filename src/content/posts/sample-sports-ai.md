# AI in the Premier League

Football is no longer just about physical prowess; it's a data game.

## Real-time Analysis

New computer vision systems installed in stadiums track every player's movement 25 times per second. This data is fed into AI models that:

*   Predict opponent strategies.
*   Suggest substitution timings.
*   Analyze injury risks.

"It's like having a supercomputer on the bench," says one anonymous manager.
